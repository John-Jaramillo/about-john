<h1>About John</h1>
<p>
    I was born in Vietnam and came to the US when I was 2 years old. Although my dad spoke Spanish and English and my mom speaks Vietnamese and English, we only spoke English at home so I am not multilingual. I've lived in Albuquerque most of my life except for a couple of years in the early 90's where I lived in Cambride, MA.
    However, sometime after starting this bootcamp I was turned into a dog, I'm not really sure how I'm going to keep coding with my paws... <i>Arf arf arf</i>
