<h1>About John</h1>
<p>
    I was born in Vietnam and came to the US when I was 2 years old. Although my dad spoke Spanish and English and my mom speaks Vietnamese and English, we only spoke English at home so I am not multilingual. I've lived in Albuquerque most of my life except for a couple of years in the early 90's where I lived in Cambride, MA (across the Charles River from Boston). I've worked numerous jobs including fast food, retail, computer tech support, manufacturing injectable drugs, and most recently, working at a call center. I hope to use the knowledge I gain in the bootcamp to jumpstart a career in tech. In the future, I would like to visit Vietnam.
