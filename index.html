<h1>About John th' Pirate</h1>
<p>
    Arr, Mateys! I was born in Vietnam 'n came t' th' US when I was 2 years ole. Although me cap'n spoke Spanish 'n English 'n me mom speaks Vietnamese 'n English, we only spoke English at home so I nah be multilingual. I've lived in Albuquerque most o' me life except fer a couple o' years in th' early 90's where I lived in Cambride, MA (cross th' Charles River from Boston). I've worked numerous jobs includin' fast food, retail, 'puter tech support, manufacturin' injectable drugs, 'n most recently, workin' at a call center. I hope t' use th' knowledge I gain in th' bootcamp t' jumpstarrt a career in tech. In th' future, I would like t' sail th' sea's n visit Vietnam.
